I add my review comments after commit d9b264d97635f4d4ebb337e6c49002662299d215.

This lacks ps7,8 while https://github.com/manjola/6.945_code from https://github.com/topics/computational-thinking?o=asc&s=updated lacks more. (Searched by 'MIT 6.945 "7" solution github'.)

This repo probably corresponds to https://web.archive.org/web/20170712054904/http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/psets/ps01 but the archived page have no ps description pdfs archived.
